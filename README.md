# Qpackt :: Website Deployment and Analytics

Qpackt is a web server that makes life a bit easier:
* Ability to serve multiple versions of your website (why you need this)
* Basic, GDPR-compliant analytics
* Auto fetch and renew SSL certificate
* GUI configuration

Qpackt is not yet production ready (see roadmap) but is able to serve itself at https://qpackt.com
